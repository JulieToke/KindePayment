# Kinde - UI Task - Junior Software Engineer

Hi!

We would like you to complete a brief code challenge for us to get an understanding of your approach to UI development.

We anticipate this will take about an hour to complete.

## Instructions

- Build out the UI as per the provided `design.png` file
- Use whatever language you are comfortable in - this could be static HTML
- Links/buttons do not have to function
- Provide a zip file with your completed project
- Please include any necessary instructions for us to run your project locally

## Useful information

### Assets

- Logos are supplied

### Colors

- Black: #000
- White: #fff
- Grey: #666
- Light grey: #fafafa

## Extra credit

We understand time restraints - so the following are entirely optional

- Making it responsive - no design supplied, use your imagination
- Factoring in how this could scale to more payment providers
- Performance considerations
- Fixing design where appropriate to be more accessible
- Considering how this would work within a larger application

## What we're looking for

The most important aspects that we will be reviewing are your attention to detail, component composition and how you think about structuring code. This will include your ability to replicate the design.

Please refrain from using any third-party CSS libraries such as Boostrap or Material Design.

**If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us!**
